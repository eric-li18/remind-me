## Required Installations
### Shell Script

The shell script requires a *nix system with a bash terminal. If not, instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for WSL, or [here](https://cmder.net/) for a console emulator. At the time of writing, the current Ubuntu version is 18.04 LTS


### Python Script
This is assuming you have Python installed _(> 2.6)_, if not, the Anaconda distribution is recommended (Selenium and many other packages come with it), and can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

To work with Selenium:

1. Download Selenium by python, via the command:

        pip install selenium

2. Download the files along with the "```chromedriver.exe```" file in the same directory
